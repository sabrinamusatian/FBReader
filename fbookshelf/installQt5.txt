1. Download Qt from https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/?hsCtaTracking=f977210e-de67-475f-a32b-65cec207fd03%7Cd62710cd-e1db-46aa-8d4d-2f1c1ffdacea
2. qtchooser -install qt5-manual <path to qmake> // You should choose the path to qmake of version 5 or higher. It usually is stored in home/Qt/5.8
3. change the path in FBReader/cookieUtility/mainwindow.cpp line 81 to path to your FBReader folder 
4. Run usuall make install
5. run FBookshelf net
Run it for now only from fbookshelf folder, because cookies would not be found other way (will be fixed soon)
6. Click save all button in Webview after login and then close the window
This window may occur twice
Probably you would get a segmentation fault now
